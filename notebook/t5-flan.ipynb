Together we work to stay in the forefront of global trends and changes within the parking industry. We listen to the needs of our customers based on everyday experience of drivers/parkers. We ensure that we are continually working to improve technology in line with what motorists want in order to make parking a pleasant experience. All this helps us ensure that our concept remains successful in an ever-changing world and contributes to making cities connected and smarter.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"\\nINCREASED EFFICIENCY\\nInstead of paper tickets, payment is linked to the vehicle's registration number. Payment can be made via our mobile app or at a parking terminal. The parking user may have a valid residents permit for their vehicle. The parking enforcement officers scan the registration number and can then see whether the fee has been paid or not.\\n\",\n",

It is used to supervise enforcement areas containing a defined number of parking spaces. Secondly, it enables data to be collected and analysed by extraction from activity reports.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"\\nSUPERVISION FOR ACCURATE REPORTS\\nFlowbird Analytics Control lets you program the available parking spaces and map the enforcement areas where the officers are operating, to provide accurate and precise analyses and reports. Connecting the service to a single server provides the interface between PDAs (enforcement by officers) and ANPR (automatic enforcement vehicle). This provides the supervisor an overview of the checks completed as well as the dematerialized transactions carried out using the ticket machines and the Flowbird application.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"\\nCOMBAT FRAUD\\nFlowbird Analytics Control supervision provides precise guidance for enforcement officers, making it possible to create routes calculated for more efficient and better distributed rounds over service zones to combat parking fraud. Enforcement Officers are directed using geolocation to vehicles suspected of repeated fraud (ANPR pre-check) to avoid scanning all vehicles. So operating costs and recovery rates are optimised. This action, spread over the different round zones, enables rapid and regular collection of payments and fines.\\n\\n\",\n",
