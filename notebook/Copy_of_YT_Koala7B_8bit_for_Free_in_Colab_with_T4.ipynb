      "    \"\\nFLOWBIRD ANALYTICS CONTROL\\nFlowbird Analytics Control is a tool for managing and mapping the deployment of parking enforcement officers. It is used to supervise enforcement areas containing a defined number of parking spaces. Secondly, it enables data to be collected and analysed by extraction from activity reports.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"\\nSUPERVISION FOR ACCURATE REPORTS\\nFlowbird Analytics Control lets you program the available parking spaces and map the enforcement areas where the officers are operating, to provide accurate and precise analyses and reports. Connecting the service to a single server provides the interface between PDAs (enforcement by officers) and ANPR (automatic enforcement vehicle). This provides the supervisor an overview of the checks completed as well as the dematerialized transactions carried out using the ticket machines and the Flowbird application.\\n\",\n",
      "    \"\\nCOMBAT FRAUD\\nFlowbird Analytics Control supervision provides precise guidance for enforcement officers, making it possible to create routes calculated for more efficient and better distributed rounds over service zones to combat parking fraud. Enforcement Officers are directed using geolocation to vehicles suspected of repeated fraud (ANPR pre-check) to avoid scanning all vehicles. So operating costs and recovery rates are optimised. This action, spread over the different round zones, enables rapid and regular collection of payments and fines.\\n\\n\",\n",
